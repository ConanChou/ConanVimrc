*cubrid_pconnect_with_url* -- Open a persistent connection to CUBRID server

  resource cubrid_pconnect_with_url(string conn_url [, string userid [, string passwd]])~

Establishes a persistent connection to a CUBRID server.

|cubrid_pconnect_with_url| acts very much like |cubrid_connect_with_url| with
two major differences.

First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent)
link that's already open with the same host, port, dbname and userid. If one
is found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new
connection.

Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution
of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open for future use
(|cubrid_close| or |cubrid_disconnect| will not close links established by
|cubrid_pconnect_with_url|).

This type of link is therefore called 'persistent'.
