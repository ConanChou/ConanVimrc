*mysql_field_seek* -- Set result pointer to a specified field offset

Use of this extension is discouraged. Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL
extension should be used. See also MySQL: choosing an API guide and related
FAQ for more information. Alternatives to this function include:

  bool mysql_field_seek(resource result, int field_offset)~

Seeks to the specified field offset. If the next call to |mysql_fetch_field|
doesn't include a field offset, the field offset specified in
|mysql_field_seek| will be returned.

{ result}The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |mysql_query|.

{ field_offset}The numerical field offset. The {field_offset} starts at 0. If
{field_offset} does not exist, an error of level E_WARNING is also issued.

Returns &true; on success or &false; on failure.

|mysql_fetch_field|
