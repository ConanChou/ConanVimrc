*hex2bin* -- Decodes a hexadecimally encoded binary string

  string hex2bin(string data)~

Decodes a hexadecimally encoded binary string.

This function does NOT convert a hexadecimal number to a binary number. This
can be done using the |base_convert| function.

Hexadecimal representation of data.

Returns the binary representation of the given data or &false; on failure.

If the hexadecimal input string is of odd length an E_WARNING level error is
thrown.

Version Description 5.4.1 A warning is thrown if the input string is of odd
length. In PHP 5.4.0 the string was silently accepted, but the last byte was
truncated.

<?php >
  $hex = hex2bin("6578616d706c65206865782064617461");
  var_dump($hex);

  string(16) "example hex data"
