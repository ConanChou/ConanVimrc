*mysql_num_rows* -- Get number of rows in result

Use of this extension is discouraged. Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL
extension should be used. See also MySQL: choosing an API guide and related
FAQ for more information. Alternatives to this function include:

  int mysql_num_rows(resource result)~

Retrieves the number of rows from a result set. This command is only valid for
statements like SELECT or SHOW that return an actual result set. To retrieve
the number of rows affected by a INSERT, UPDATE, REPLACE or DELETE query, use
|mysql_affected_rows|.

{ result}The result resource that is being evaluated. This result comes from a
call to |mysql_query|.

The number of rows in a result set on success or &false; on failure.

|mysql_num_rows| example

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect("localhost", "mysql_user", "mysql_password");
  mysql_select_db("database", $link);
  
  $result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM table1", $link);
  $num_rows = mysql_num_rows($result);
  
  echo "$num_rows Rows\n";
?>





If you use |mysql_unbuffered_query|, |mysql_num_rows| will not return the
correct value until all the rows in the result set have been retrieved.

For backward compatibility, the following deprecated alias may be used:
|mysql_numrows|

|mysql_affected_rows| |mysql_connect| |mysql_data_seek| |mysql_select_db|
|mysql_query|
