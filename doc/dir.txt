*dir* -- Return an instance of the Directory class

  Directory dir(string directory [, resource context])~

A pseudo-object oriented mechanism for reading a directory. The given
{directory} is opened.

Directory to open

Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of contexts, refer
to .



Returns an instance of Directory, or &null; with wrong parameters, or &false;
in case of another error.

|dir| example Please note the fashion in which |Directory::read|'s return
value is checked in the example below. We are explicitly testing whether the
return value is identical to (equal to and of the same type as - see
Comparison Operators for more information) &false; since otherwise, any
directory entry whose name evaluates to &false; will stop the loop.

<?php >
  $d = dir("/etc/php5");
  echo "Handle: " . $d->handle . "\n";
  echo "Path: " . $d->path . "\n";
  while (false !== ($entry = $d->read())) {
     echo $entry."\n";
  }
  $d->close();
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Handle: Resource id #2
  Path: /etc/php5
  .
  ..
  apache
  cgi
  cli



The order in which directory entries are returned by the read method is
system-dependent.
