*eio_init* -- (Re-)initialize Eio

  void eio_init()~

|eio_init| (re-)initializes Eio. It allocates memory for internal structures
of libeio and Eio itself. You may call |eio_init| before using Eio functions.
Otherwise it will be called internally first time you invoke an Eio function
in a process.

This deprecated feature will certainly be removed in the future. Since Eio
1.1.0 |eio_init| is deprecated. In Eio 1.0.0 because of libeio's restrictions
you must call |eio_init| in child process, if you fork one by any means. You
have to avoid using Eio in parent process, if you use it in childs.

This function has no parameters.

No value is returned.
