*bzopen* -- Opens a bzip2 compressed file

  resource bzopen(string filename, string mode)~

|bzopen| opens a bzip2 (.bz2) file for reading or writing.

{filename} The name of the file to open.

{mode} Similar to the |fopen| function, only 'r' (read) and 'w' (write) are
supported. Everything else will cause bzopen to return &false;.

If the open fails, |bzopen| returns &false;, otherwise it returns a pointer to
the newly opened file.

|bzopen| example

<?php >
  $file = "/tmp/foo.bz2";
  $bz = bzopen($file, "r") or die("Couldn't open $file for reading");
  
  bzclose($bz);
?>





|bzclose|
