*mysqlnd_ms_set_qos* -- Sets the quality of service needed from the cluster

  bool mysqlnd_ms_set_qos(mixed connection, int service_level [, int service_level_option [, mixed option_value]])~

Sets the quality of service needed from the cluster. A database cluster
delivers a certain quality of service to the user depending on its
architecture. A major aspect of the quality of service is the consistency
level the cluster can offer. An asynchronous MySQL replication cluster
defaults to eventual consistency for slave reads: a slave may serve stale
data, current data, or it may have not the requested data at all, because it
is not synchronous to the master. In a MySQL replication cluster, only master
accesses can give strong consistency, which promises that all clients see each
others changes.

PECL/mysqlnd_ms hides the complexity of choosing appropriate nodes to achieve
a certain level of service from the cluster. The "Quality of Service" filter
implements the necessary logic. The filter can either be configured in the
plugins configuration file, or at runtime using |mysqlnd_ms_set_qos|.
