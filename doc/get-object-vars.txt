*get_object_vars* -- Gets the properties of the given object

  array get_object_vars(object object)~

Gets the accessible non-static properties of the given {object} according to
scope.

{object} An object instance.

Returns an associative array of defined object accessible non-static
properties for the specified {object} in scope. If a property have not been
assigned a value, it will be returned with a &null; value.

Version Description 5.3.0 This function now returns NULL if the {object} isn't
an object. Previously &false; was returned. 4.2.0 Properties which were
declared in the class of the {object} but which weren't assigned a value are
now also returned (with value &null;).

Use of |get_object_vars|

<?php >
  class foo {
      private $a;
      public $b = 1;
      public $c;
      private $d;
      static $e;
     
      public function test() {
          var_dump(get_object_vars($this));
      }
  }
  
  $test = new foo;
  var_dump(get_object_vars($test));
  
  $test->test();
?>

The above example will output:

  array(2) {
    ["b"]=>
    int(1)
    ["c"]=>
    NULL
  }
  array(4) {
    ["a"]=>
    NULL
    ["b"]=>
    int(1)
    ["c"]=>
    NULL
    ["d"]=>
    NULL
  }
