*mysql_ping* -- Ping a server connection or reconnect if there is no connection

Use of this extension is discouraged. Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL
extension should be used. See also MySQL: choosing an API guide and related
FAQ for more information. Alternatives to this function include:

  bool mysql_ping([resource link_identifier])~

Checks whether or not the connection to the server is working. If it has gone
down, an automatic reconnection is attempted. This function can be used by
scripts that remain idle for a long while, to check whether or not the server
has closed the connection and reconnect if necessary.

Automatic reconnection is disabled by default in versions of MySQL >= 5.0.3.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error
is generated.

Returns &true; if the connection to the server MySQL server is working,
otherwise &false;.

A |mysql_ping| example

<?php >
  set_time_limit(0);
  
  $conn = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysqluser', 'mypass');
  $db   = mysql_select_db('mydb');
  
  /* Assuming this query will take a long time */
  $result = mysql_query($sql);
  if (!$result) {
      echo 'Query #1 failed, exiting.';
      exit;
  }
  
  /* Make sure the connection is still alive, if not, try to reconnect */
  if (!mysql_ping($conn)) {
      echo 'Lost connection, exiting after query #1';
      exit;
  }
  mysql_free_result($result);
  
  /* So the connection is still alive, let's run another query */
  $result2 = mysql_query($sql2);
?>
