*fgetc* -- Gets character from file pointer

  string fgetc(resource handle)~

Gets a character from the given file pointer.

{handle} The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully
opened by |fopen| or |fsockopen| (and not yet closed by |fclose|).

Returns a string containing a single character read from the file pointed to
by {handle}. Returns &false; on EOF.

This function may return Boolean &false;, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to &false;. Please read the section on Booleans for more
information. Use the === operator for testing the return value of this
function.

A |fgetc| example

<?php >
  $fp = fopen('somefile.txt', 'r');
  if (!$fp) {
      echo 'Could not open file somefile.txt';
  }
  while (false !== ($char = fgetc($fp))) {
      echo "$char\n";
  }
?>





This function is binary-safe.
