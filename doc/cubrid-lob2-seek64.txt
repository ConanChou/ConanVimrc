*cubrid_lob2_seek64* -- Move the cursor of a lob object.

  bool cubrid_lob2_seek64(resource lob_identifier, string offset [, int origin])~

The |cubrid_lob2_seek64| function is used to move the cursor position of a lob
object by the value set in the {offset} argument, to the direction set in the
{origin} argument. If the {offset} you want to move is larger than an integer
data can be stored, you can use this function.

To set the {origin} argument, you can use CUBRID_CURSOR_FIRST to set the
cursor position moving forward {offset} units from the first beginning. In
this case, {offset} must be a positive value.

If you use CUBRID_CURSOR_CURRENT for {origin}, you can move forward or
backward. and {offset} can be positive or negative.

If you use CUBRID_CURSOR_LAST for {origin}, you can move backward {offset}
units from the end of LOB object and {offset} only can be positive.

If you use this function to move the cursor position of the lob object, you
should pass {offset} as a string.

{lob_identifier} Lob identifier as a result of |cubrid_lob2_new| or get from
the result set.

{offset} Number of units you want to move the cursor.

{origin} This parameter can be the following values:

CUBRID_CURSOR_FIRST: move forward from the first beginning.

CUBRID_CURSOR_CURRENT: move forward or backward from the current position.

CUBRID_CURSOR_LAST: move backward at the end of LOB object.

&true; if the process is successful and &false; for failure.
