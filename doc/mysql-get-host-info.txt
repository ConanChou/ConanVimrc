*mysql_get_host_info* -- Get MySQL host info

Use of this extension is discouraged. Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL
extension should be used. See also MySQL: choosing an API guide and related
FAQ for more information. Alternatives to this function include:

  string mysql_get_host_info([resource link_identifier])~

Describes the type of connection in use for the connection, including the
server host name.

{ link_identifier}The MySQL connection. If the link identifier is not
specified, the last link opened by |mysql_connect| is assumed. If no such link
is found, it will try to create one as if |mysql_connect| was called with no
arguments. If no connection is found or established, an E_WARNING level error
is generated.

Returns a string describing the type of MySQL connection in use for the
connection or &false; on failure.

|mysql_get_host_info| example

<?php >
  $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password');
  if (!$link) {
      die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
  }
  printf("MySQL host info: %s\n", mysql_get_host_info());
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  MySQL host info: Localhost via UNIX socket



|mysql_get_client_info| |mysql_get_proto_info| |mysql_get_server_info|
