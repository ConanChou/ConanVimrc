{pid} If not specified, the pid of the current process is used.

{process_identifier} One of PRIO_PGRP, PRIO_USER or PRIO_PROCESS.

|pcntl_getpriority| returns the priority of the process or &false; on error. A
lower numerical value causes more favorable scheduling.

This function may return Boolean &false;, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to &false;. Please read the section on Booleans for more
information. Use the === operator for testing the return value of this
function.
